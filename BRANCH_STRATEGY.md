# Branch and Tag Strategy for Learning Hub

Recommendations for organizing repository branches and tags to support the MetricsStream Learning Hub.

## Executive Summary

**Problem**: Current repository has only one commit with final optimized code. Learners cannot experience the progression from baseline to optimized.

**Solution**: Create learning branches that represent different optimization phases, allowing learners to check out and work from each phase.

**Recommended Approach**: **Option B - Progressive Learning Branches** (see details below)

---

## Current Repository State

- **Commits**: 1 (9dd194d - "Update decision tree with Phase 6 & 7 optimizations")
- **Branches**: main, claude/issue-7-20251004-1848
- **Tags**: None
- **State**: Contains fully optimized implementation (Phase 6+)

**Implications**:
- Cannot `git checkout` historical states
- Need to manually create earlier phases by removing features
- Learning Hub must provide starter code for each phase

---

## Strategy Options

### Option A: Single Learning Branch ⭐⭐

**Concept**: One frozen branch with all TODOs present, learners implement features incrementally.

```
main (optimized) ← read-only reference
  ↓
learning-start ← frozen baseline
  ↓
[Learners fork and work here]
```

**Pros**:
- Simple to maintain (one branch)
- Clear starting point for all learners
- Easy to sync with main for bug fixes

**Cons**:
- Learners must implement ALL phases sequentially
- Can't start at intermediate phase
- Less flexible for different skill levels

**Use Case**: Bootcamp-style learning where all students start together

---

### Option B: Progressive Learning Branches ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (RECOMMENDED)

**Concept**: Multiple branches representing each phase, learners can start at any level.

```
main (Phase 6+: Thread pool) ← production reference
  ↑
phase-6-thread-pool ← completed Phase 6
  ↑
phase-5-lock-free ← completed Phase 5 (TODO: implement Phase 6)
  ↑
phase-4-mutex-pool ← completed Phase 4 (TODO: implement Phase 5)
  ↑
phase-3-json-optimized ← completed Phase 3 (TODO: implement Phase 4)
  ↑
phase-2-async-io ← completed Phase 2 (TODO: implement Phase 3)
  ↑
phase-1-threading ← completed Phase 1 (TODO: implement Phase 2)
  ↑
phase-0-baseline ← sequential processing (TODO: implement Phase 1)
```

**Pros**:
- Start at any skill level
- Jump to specific optimization phase
- Each branch is a checkpoint
- Can compare solutions across branches

**Cons**:
- More branches to maintain
- Need to backport bug fixes to all branches
- Requires initial effort to create branches

**Use Case**: Self-paced learning, mixed skill levels, focused practice

**Recommendation**: ✅ **THIS IS THE BEST OPTION**

---

### Option C: Tags on Feature Commits ⭐⭐⭐

**Concept**: Tag each phase implementation if commit history existed.

```
v0.0-baseline → v0.1-phase1 → v0.2-phase2 → ... → v1.0-final
```

**Pros**:
- Lightweight (tags, not branches)
- Follows standard versioning
- Easy to reference in documentation

**Cons**:
- **NOT APPLICABLE**: Requires historical commits (we only have 1)
- Would need to create commits first, then tag them
- Less discoverable than branches

**Use Case**: Only viable if commit history is reconstructed first

---

### Option D: Separate Learning Repository ⭐⭐⭐

**Concept**: Fork repository for learning, keep main for production.

```
kapil0x/MetricsStream (production)
  ↓ fork
kapil0x/MetricsStream-Learning (educational)
  ↓ multiple branches
  phase-0, phase-1, phase-2, ...
```

**Pros**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Production repo stays clean
- Learning repo can have tests, hints, solutions

**Cons**:
- Two repos to maintain
- Need to sync bug fixes
- More complex for learners (which repo?)

**Use Case**: Large-scale educational deployment, online course

---

## Recommended Implementation: Option B

### Step-by-Step Creation

#### Phase 0: Baseline (Sequential Processing)

**Branch**: `phase-0-baseline`

**Features to Remove from main**:
- Thread pool → replace with sequential accept loop
- Lock-free ring buffer → remove metrics collection
- Hash-based mutex pool → remove mutex pool
- Optimized JSON parser → use naive parser only
- Async I/O → synchronous file writes
- Thread-per-request → sequential handling

**Resulting Code**:
```cpp
// Simple sequential server
while (running) {
    int client_socket = accept(...);
    handle_request(client_socket);  // Blocks here
    close(client_socket);
}
```

**Performance**: ~50-100 RPS

**TODO for Learners**:
```cpp
// TODO(human): Exercise 1.1 - Implement thread-per-request model
// Current: Sequential processing (one request at a time)
// Task: Spawn thread for each connection to enable concurrency
// Expected: 88% success rate at 20 clients
```

---

// Expected: Prevent abuse, prepare for flush_metrics implementation
```

---

#### Phase 4: Hash-Based Mutex Pool

**Branch**: `phase-4-mutex-pool`

**Features**:

// WARNING: Advanced exercise - study memory ordering first!
```

---

#### Phase 5: Lock-Free Ring Buffer

**Branch**: `phase-5-lock-free`

**Features**:
- ✅ Lock-free metrics collection
- ✅ Atomic ring buffer with memory ordering
- ✅ Rate limiting
- ✅ All previous optimizations
- ❌ Still using thread-per-request (limit at 150+ clients)

**Performance**: ~1000+ RPS, limited by thread creation

**TODO for Learners**:
```cpp
// TODO(human): Exercise 6.1 - Implement thread pool
// Current: Thread creation overhead limits scalability
// Task: Replace thread-per-request with fixed worker pool
// Expected: Handle 200+ clients, graceful degradation with 503
```

---

```

---

### Branch Creation Commands

```bash
# Start from main (fully optimized code)
git checkout main

# Create phase-0-baseline
git checkout -b phase-0-baseline
# Manually remove features (see Phase 0 section above)
# Keep only basic sequential server
git add .
git commit -m "Phase 0: Baseline sequential server

Starting point for learning path. Single-threaded sequential request
processing with naive JSON parser and synchronous I/O.

Performance: ~50-100 RPS
Next: Implement thread-per-request (Exercise 1.1)"
git push origin phase-0-baseline

# Create phase-1-threading
git checkout main
git checkout -b phase-1-threading
# Remove: async I/O, JSON optimization, rate limiting, thread pool
# Keep: thread-per-request, basic mutex
git add .
git commit -m "Phase 1: Thread-per-request model

Concurrent request handling with thread spawning. Basic mutex for
file writes.

Performance: ~200 RPS, 88% success at 20 clients
Next: Implement async I/O (Exercise 2.1)"
git push origin phase-1-threading

# Repeat for each phase...
```

---

### Branch Protection Rules

Protect learning branches from accidental changes:

```yaml
Branch Protection Rules:
- phase-*: Protected
  - Require pull request reviews: Yes
  - Require status checks: Yes
  - Restrict who can push: Maintainers only
  - Allow force pushes: No
```

**Rationale**: Learning branches are "frozen" checkpoints. Only maintainers should update for bug fixes.

---

## Documentation Updates

### Update README.md

```markdown
## Learning Path

This repository supports hands-on learning through progressive optimization phases.

### For Learners

Start at any phase based on your skill level:

- **Beginner**: Start at `phase-0-baseline` - sequential server
- **Intermediate**: Start at `phase-2-async-io` - focus on algorithms
- **Advanced**: Start at `phase-4-mutex-pool` - focus on lock-free

```bash
# Check out the starting point
git checkout phase-0-baseline

# Follow LEARNING_PATH.md for exercises
```

### For Reference

The `main` branch contains the final optimized implementation. Use it as:
- Reference solution for exercises
- Production-ready example
- Comparison for your implementation

See [LEARNING_PATH.md](LEARNING_PATH.md) for detailed guide.
```

---

### Update LEARNING_PATH.md

Add branch references to each lesson:

```markdown
### Lesson 1.1: Thread-Per-Request Model

**Starter Code**: Branch `phase-0-baseline`

```bash
git checkout phase-0-baseline
# Start working from here
```

**Reference Solution**: Branch `phase-1-threading`

```bash
# After completing exercise, compare with reference
git diff phase-0-baseline phase-1-threading
```
```

---

## Testing Strategy for Learning Branches

### Automated Testing

Each branch should pass phase-appropriate tests:

```bash
# phase-0-baseline
make test-phase-0
# Tests: Basic functionality, single-threaded correctness

# phase-1-threading
make test-phase-1
# Tests: Thread safety, concurrent correctness

# phase-2-async-io
make test-phase-2
# Tests: Async behavior, no lost metrics

# ... etc
```

### CI/CD for Learning Branches

```yaml
# .github/workflows/learning-branches.yml
name: Test Learning Branches

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'phase-*'

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Build
        run: mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make
      - name: Test
        run: |
          # Run phase-appropriate tests
          ./test_phase_${GITHUB_REF##*/}
      - name: Load Test
        run: |
          # Performance regression test
          ./load_test 8080 50 10
```

---

## Synchronization Strategy

### Bug Fixes Across Branches

When bug found in any branch:

1. Fix in `main` first
2. Cherry-pick to all affected `phase-*` branches
3. Update tests if needed

```bash
# Fix bug in main
git checkout main
# Make fix
git commit -m "fix: resolve buffer overflow in parser"

# Backport to phase-3 (where parser was introduced)
git checkout phase-3-json-optimized
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
git push origin phase-3-json-optimized

# Backport to all subsequent phases
git checkout phase-4-mutex-pool
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
# ... etc
```

### Feature Additions to Main

New features go to `main` only, not learning branches.

**Rationale**: Learning branches are "frozen in time" for educational stability.

---

## Alternative: Auto-Generated Learning Branches

### Scripted Approach

Create script to auto-generate branches from main:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/generate_learning_branches.sh

generate_phase_0() {
    git checkout main
    git checkout -b phase-0-baseline-temp

    # Remove features programmatically
    sed -i 's/thread_pool_/\/\/ thread_pool_/g' src/http_server.cpp
    # ... more automated removals

    git commit -am "Phase 0: Generated baseline"
    git branch -f phase-0-baseline
    git checkout main
    git branch -D phase-0-baseline-temp
}

# Run for each phase
generate_phase_0
generate_phase_1
# ...
```

**Pros**: Reproducible, easy to regenerate
**Cons**: Complex script, may break code

## Migration from Current State

### Current State
- 1 commit with all features
- No learning branches
- Documentation mentions phases but no code checkpoints

### Target State
- 7+ branches (phase-0 through phase-6+)
- Each branch is a learning checkpoint
- Learners can start at any level
- Reference solutions available

### Migration Steps

1. **Audit main branch**: Understand all features
2. **Plan removals**: Document what to remove for each phase
3. **Create phase-6**: Tag current main as phase-6
4. **Work backwards**: Remove features phase by phase
5. **Test each branch**: Ensure builds and runs
6. **Document TODOs**: Add learning TODOs to each branch
7. **Update docs**: Reference branches in LEARNING_PATH.md
8. **Protect branches**: Add protection rules
9. **Announce**: Update Learning Hub and notify learners
