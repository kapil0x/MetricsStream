---

## Active TODOs

### TODO #1: Performance Monitoring in Main Loop

**Location**: `src/main.cpp:36`

**Status**: ⏳ Open (Enhancement Opportunity)

**Code Context**:
```cpp
while (true) {
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));

    // TODO(human): Add performance monitoring here
    // Consider tracking and logging:
    // - Active connection count
    // - Request processing time distribution
    // - Queue depths and memory usage
    // - Failed vs successful request ratios
    // This will help identify bottlenecks at high load
```

**Description**: Add comprehensive performance monitoring to track system health metrics during runtime.

**Suggested Implementation**:
- Track active connection count from HTTP server
- Monitor request processing latency distribution (p50, p95, p99)
- Track queue depths in thread pool and async writer
- Monitor memory usage trends
- Calculate and log failed vs successful request ratios

**Priority**: Medium - useful for production monitoring and debugging

**Learning Opportunity**: ✅ **Yes - Good First Issue**
- Teaches observability and metrics collection
- Introduces percentile calculations
- Practice with system monitoring patterns

**Estimated Effort**: 2-4 hours

### TODO #2: Sliding Window Rate Limiting Algorithm

**Location**: `src/ingestion_service.cpp:12`

**Status**: ✅ Implemented (but TODO comment remains)

**Code Context**:
```cpp
// TODO(human): Implement sliding window rate limiting algorithm
// Consider using a token bucket or sliding window approach
// Store client request counts with timestamps
```

**Actual Implementation Status**: **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

The sliding window rate limiting is already implemented starting at line 30 (`RateLimiter::allow_request`):
- Uses `std::deque` to store timestamps per client
- Removes timestamps older than 1 second (line 48-60)
- Checks if queue size is below limit (line 64-69)
- Thread-safe with hash-based mutex pool (Phase 4 optimization)

**Action Required**: Remove or update this TODO comment to reflect implementation status.

**Learning Value**: ✅ **Excellent Teaching Example**
- Shows sliding window algorithm in production
- Demonstrates concurrent data structure design
- Good example of optimization progression (basic → hash-based locking)

## Documentation References (Not Code TODOs)

### Reference #3: README.md Contributing Section

**Location**: `README.md:122`

**Content**:
```markdown
## Contributing

Open issue: `flush_metrics()` needs safe multi-client iteration without deadlocks.
See TODO(human) in `src/ingestion_service.cpp`.
```

**Status**: ⚠️ **OUTDATED** - `flush_metrics()` is fully implemented

**Current Implementation**:
- File: `src/ingestion_service.cpp:106-151`
- Uses lock-free ring buffer approach (Phase 5 optimization)
- No deadlock risk - atomic operations for metrics reading
- Single mutex only for client list snapshot

**Action Required**: Update README to reflect that this is now a **reference implementation** rather than an open contribution opportunity.

---

### Reference #4: CLAUDE.md Current Focus

**Location**: `CLAUDE.md:142`

**Content**:
```markdown
## Current Focus

Phase 4: Hash-based per-client mutex optimization to eliminate double mutex
bottleneck in rate limiting. See TODO(human) in `flush_metrics()` for
contribution opportunity.
```

**Status**: ⚠️ **OUTDATED** - Project is actually at Phase 6

**Actual Status**:
- Phase 4 (hash-based mutex): ✅ Implemented
- Phase 5 (lock-free ring buffer): ✅ Implemented
- Phase 6 (thread pool): ✅ Implemented
- `flush_metrics()`: ✅ Fully implemented with lock-free approach

**Action Required**: Update CLAUDE.md to reflect current state (Phase 6+ complete).

## Implemented Features (Former TODOs)

These were likely TODOs during development but are now fully implemented:

### ✅ flush_metrics() - Lock-free Multi-Client Iteration

**Implementation**: `src/ingestion_service.cpp:106-151`

**Solution Approach**: Lock-free ring buffer with atomic indices

**Key Techniques**:
- Single mutex for client list snapshot only
- Atomic `read_index` and `write_index` for lock-free access
- Memory ordering: `acquire`/`release` semantics
- I/O operations outside critical sections

**Learning Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Advanced concurrency patterns
- Lock-free programming
- Memory ordering semantics
- Producer-consumer pattern

**Should Be Exercise**: ✅ **YES** - with multiple solution paths:
1. **Beginner**: Lock ordering (sorted acquisition)
2. **Intermediate**: Try-lock pattern
3. **Advanced**: Lock-free ring buffer (current implementation)

---

### ✅ Custom JSON Parser - Single-Pass Optimization

**Implementation**: `src/ingestion_service.cpp:340-522`

**Solution Approach**: State machine parser with pre-allocated buffers

**Key Techniques**:
- Single-pass character iteration (O(n) vs O(n²))
- Pre-allocated string buffers
- Direct numeric parsing with `strtod()`
- Eliminated multiple `find()` and `substr()` calls

**Performance Impact**:
- 100 clients: 80.2% success rate, 2.73ms latency
- Eliminated JSON parsing as bottleneck

**Learning Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Algorithm optimization (O(n²) → O(n))
- State machines
- Memory allocation strategies
- Performance profiling

**Should Be Exercise**: ✅ **YES** - Natural progression from naive to optimized

---

### ✅ Async I/O with Producer-Consumer Pattern

**Implementation**: `src/ingestion_service.cpp:729-761`

**Solution Approach**: Background writer thread with queue

**Key Techniques**:
- `std::queue` for batch buffering
- `std::condition_variable` for thread coordination
- Lock released before I/O operations
- Graceful shutdown handling

**Learning Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Threading fundamentals
- Producer-consumer pattern
- Condition variables
- I/O optimization

**Should Be Exercise**: ✅ **YES** - Core systems programming pattern

---

### ✅ Thread Pool Implementation

**Implementation**: `include/thread_pool.h`, `src/thread_pool.cpp`

**Solution Approach**: Fixed worker pool with task queue and backpressure

**Key Techniques**:
- Fixed-size worker pool (default 16 threads)
- Bounded task queue (max 10,000 tasks)
- Backpressure mechanism (return `false` when full)
- Clean shutdown with condition variable notification

**Performance Impact**:
- Eliminates thread creation overhead at 150+ concurrent clients
- Enables 503 responses under overload (vs crashes)

**Learning Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Thread pool pattern (production-critical skill)
- Backpressure and load shedding
- Resource management
- Graceful degradation

**Should Be Exercise**: ✅ **YES** - Essential systems programming

## Recommendations

### For Learning Hub

1. **Remove Outdated TODOs**: Update README and CLAUDE.md to reflect current state
2. **Create Learning Branches**: Freeze code at earlier states for exercises
3. **Progressive Exercises**: Build from Phase 1 → Phase 6
4. **Show Evolution**: Each phase as a learning module with before/after code

### For Repository

1. **Clean Up Comments**: Remove or update the TODO at line 12 of `ingestion_service.cpp`
2. **Update Documentation**: Sync README and CLAUDE.md with actual implementation state
3. **Add New TODOs**: If performance monitoring (TODO #1) is desired, keep it; otherwise remove
4. **Tag Releases**: Create git tags for each phase state (if commit history exists elsewhere)

### For Contributors

1. **TODO #1 (Performance Monitoring)**: Good first issue - clear scope, educational value
2. **Future TODOs**: Consider adding:
   - Prometheus/OpenMetrics format support
   - Distributed tracing integration
   - Query API implementation
   - Time-series storage integration
