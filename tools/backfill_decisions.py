        solution_chosen="Thread-per-request model: spawn new thread for each incoming HTTP request",
        alternatives_considered="1) Sequential processing - too slow; 2) Thread pool - more complex, premature optimization; 3) Async I/O - requires complete rewrite",
        rationale="Simple implementation providing immediate parallelism gains. Each request gets dedicated thread, avoiding head-of-line blocking. Acceptable for initial scale (<100 concurrent clients)",
        code_files_affected=["src/http_server.cpp", "src/main.cpp"],

        alternatives_considered="1) Synchronous writing - causes request timeouts; 2) Per-request file handles - resource exhaustion; 3) Memory-only buffer - data loss risk",
        rationale="Decouples critical path (request processing) from I/O operations. Background writer batches multiple metrics for efficient disk writes. Non-blocking enqueue keeps request threads responsive",
