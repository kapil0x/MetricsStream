=== Phase 3: JSON Parsing Optimization Results ===
Optimized Single-Pass Parser Implementation:

50 Clients:  500 requests → 324 successful (64.8% success) → 2.25ms latency
100 Clients: 1000 requests → 802 successful (80.2% success) → 2.73ms latency  
150 Clients: 1200 requests → 681 successful (56.8% success) → 4.18ms latency

Key Performance Improvements:
- Eliminated multiple string::find() operations per field
- Reduced memory allocations through pre-allocated buffers
- Single-pass character iteration vs multi-pass string scanning
- Direct numeric parsing with strtod() vs string conversion chains

Remaining Bottlenecks Identified:
- Thread creation limits at 150+ concurrent clients
- Rate limiting mutex contention under extreme load
- Connection handling capacity constraints
